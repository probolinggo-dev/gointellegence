# Contributing to Go Intellegence

We would love for you to contribute to Nest and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

## Found bug

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Missing a Feature

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
